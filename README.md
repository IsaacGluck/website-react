### My personal website (v2).

I built this website using **Node** and **React** to show off what I\'ve been working on and to practice my web development skills. All the styling was done myself. You can see my first attempt at a personal website <a href="IsaacGluck.github.io">here</a> (Using raw **HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap**)


*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
